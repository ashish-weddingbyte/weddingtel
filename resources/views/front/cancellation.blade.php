                            Cancellations will be viewed only if the cancellation is submitted inside 24 hours of submitting and order of membership. Cancellation and refund of fees or charges will be carefully represented by the Company Refund Policy of the organisation informed and declared from time to time.
                            <br>
                            No cancellations are entertained for those services involving voucher usage that the Weddingbyte.com marketing team has obtained on special discounts and offers on special events and festivals etc. These are limited time offers and therefore cancellations  requests cannot be processed
